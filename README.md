Fish O' Plenty (fop.) is a script to make simple fish shell themes.

## Inner Workings

fop consists of "parts" which make up the fish theme. Parts like the username, the "@" sign, even syntax highligting. The user can customize these parts and change their color and visibility. Those parts are iterated trough and added to the "themecode": a variable that keeps the fish script for the theme.
